# Project-3

## Project Summary
The dataset we collected provided a comprehensive analysis into US travel check-ins from Instagram. It includes extensive data scraped from Instagram, such as the location of check-in, crime rate per state, average temperature, latitude and longitude coordinates for every entry. This data helped us discover the ever-changing trends on how travelers choose their vacation destinations. We created a website with interactive dropdowns and tools to visualize the given data inputs. 

## Navigating the Website
1.	Open the website using https://meera-patel01-travel-check-ins-app-app-c2bhzm.streamlit.app/

2. Navigation
    - If you would like to know the ethical considerations for this project then select the Ethics button on the left.
    - Steps
        1. To start you must pick the state you are planning to travel to.
        2. You must then decide what information you would like to know about the state.
            - If you would like to know the average temperature in the state you chose during each season then select the Temperature button on the left.
            - If you would like to know the average number of incidents for each type of crime and the percent of the total the crime is for the state you chose then select the Crime button on the left.
            - If you would like to find things to do in the state you chose then select the Map button on the left.

## Ethical Considerations 
Data ethics encompasses the moral obligation in collecting, protecting, sharing and using data. Researchers must consider the rights and privacy of individuals whose data is being collected. Ethical considerations that we took into account when collecting our data include:
-	Respect ethical guidelines and privacy concerns when using datasets. 
-	Complies with data protection regulations and users do not misuse or misrepresent the data. 
-	Crediting original author of the data.
  
While most data posted on social media platforms like Instagram, is assumed to be in the public domain as users agree to allow third parties to use data when agreeing to the terms of use; there were ethical considerations taken into account such as users’ name privacy and safety. 



## Data Visualization Track
For this track, our group is presenting using data visualizations. Here are the specific requirements:
1.	Our project includes visualizations created with:
  -Python (Matplotlib)
  -JavaScript ( Plotly )
  -Streamlit as visualization that was not covered in class. 
4.	Data was extracted from PostgreSQL and SQLite
5.	Our project includes Streamlit as the library that we did not cover.
6.	Data is powered by a dataset with over 100 records.
7.	This project includes a user-driven interaction.
8.	The final visualization includes multiple views.
