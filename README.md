# Project-3

## Project Summary
We gathered temperature, location, date, and crime data to create a website with interactive dropdowns and tools to visualize the given data inputs. Our Project 3 objectives were to gather weather and travel information to analyze travel trends and data from 2016-2018 and draw correlations and connections to see if weather, crime or time of year influence travelers' decisions on where to go during a given time.


## Ethical Considerations 
Data ethics encompasses the moral obligation in collecting, protecting, sharing and using data. Researchers must consider the rights and privacy of individuals whose data is being collected. Ethical considerations that we took into account when collecting our data include:
-	Respect ethical guidelines and privacy concerns when using datasets. 
-	Ensure that research complies with data protection regulations and that users do not misuse or misrepresent the data. 
-	Be transparent about any limitations or biases in the dataset.
-	Crediting original author of the data



## Data Visualization Track
For this track, our group is presenting using data visualizations. Here are the specific requirements:
1.	Our project includes visualizations created with:
  -Python (Matplotlib)
  -JavaScript ( Plotly )
  -Streamlit as visualization that was not covered in class. 
4.	Data was extracted from PostgreSQL and SQLite
5.	Our project includes Streamlit as the library that we did not cover.
6.	Data is powered by a dataset with over 100 records.
7.	This project includes a user-driven interaction.
8.	The final visualization includes multiple views.
