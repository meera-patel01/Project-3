# Project-3

## Project Summary
The dataset we collected provided a comprehensive analysis into US travel check-ins from Instagram. It includes extensive data scraped from Instagram, such as the location of check-in, crime rate per state, average temperature, latitude and longitude coordinates for every entry. This data helped us discover the ever-changing trends on how travelers choose their vacation destinations.

Our project 3 objectives were to analyze the data we’ve collected from 2016-2018 and draw correlations and connections to see if weather, crime rate, or time of year influence traveler’s decisions on where to go during a given time. We created a website with interactive dropdowns and tools to visualize the given data inputs. 

## Navigating the Website
1.	Install Streamlit and Folium
-	Pip install streamlit
-	Pip install folium
-	Pip install streamlit-folium

2.	In terminal run app.py
-	Streamlit run app.py

3.	On our website, first select a chosen state and then click on Temperature to see the average temperature for the state per season, Crime for the average US crime, and Map for things to do in your chosen state


## Ethical Considerations 
Data ethics encompasses the moral obligation in collecting, protecting, sharing and using data. Researchers must consider the rights and privacy of individuals whose data is being collected. Ethical considerations that we took into account when collecting our data include:
-	Respect ethical guidelines and privacy concerns when using datasets. 
-	Complies with data protection regulations and users do not misuse or misrepresent the data. 
-	Crediting original author of the data.
  
While most data posted on social media platforms like Instagram, is assumed to be in the public domain as users agree to allow third parties to use data when agreeing to the terms of use; there were ethical considerations taken into account such as users’ name privacy and safety. 



## Data Visualization Track
For this track, our group is presenting using data visualizations. Here are the specific requirements:
1.	Our project includes visualizations created with:
  -Python (Matplotlib)
  -JavaScript ( Plotly )
  -Streamlit as visualization that was not covered in class. 
4.	Data was extracted from PostgreSQL and SQLite
5.	Our project includes Streamlit as the library that we did not cover.
6.	Data is powered by a dataset with over 100 records.
7.	This project includes a user-driven interaction.
8.	The final visualization includes multiple views.
