## Ethical Considerations 
Data ethics encompasses the moral obligation in collecting, protecting, sharing and using data. Researchers must consider the rights and privacy of individuals whose data is being collected. Ethical considerations that we took into account when collecting our data include:
-	Respect ethical guidelines and privacy concerns when using datasets. 
-	Ensure that research complies with data protection regulations and that users do not misuse or misrepresent the data. 
-	Be transparent about any limitations or biases in the dataset.
-	Crediting original author of the data
